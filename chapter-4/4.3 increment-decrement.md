# Increment and Decrement Operators

- increment == add one
- decrement == subtract one

We could do 
```
i = i + 1;
j = j - 1;
```
But we can condense it with
```
i += 1;
j -= 1;
```
And even further with
```
i++;
j--;
```

- They can be used as prefix operators (`++i` or `--i`) or postfix operators (`i++` or `i--`).
- They have side effects

A pre increment ++i yields i+1 and as side effect increments i
```
i = 1;
printf("i is %d\n", ++i); // prints i is 2
printf("i is %d\n", i); // prints i is 2
```
A post increment i++ yields i but causes i to be incremented afterwards
```
i = 1;
printf("i is %d\n", i++); // prints i is 1
printf("i is %d\n", i); // prints i is 2
```
- The first one shows i before incrementing and the second shows th enew value
- so tldr ++i means increment i immediately while i++ means use the old value of i for now and increment it later
  - How much later? who knows it's not specified but it'll happen before the next statement is executed
- `--` works similarly
When ++ or -- is used more than once in the same expression the result can be confusing
```
i = 1;
j = 2;
k = ++i + j++;
```
since i is incremented before it's used but j is incremented after it's used the last statement is the same as:
```
i = i + 1;
k = i + j;
j = j + 1;
```
So the final values of i,j,k are 2,3,4 respectively. 

In contrast, executing
```
i = 1;
j = 2;
k = i++ + j++;
```
Will give i,j,k the values 2,3,3 respectively

For the record the postfix versions of ++ and -- have higher precedence than unary plus and minus and are left associative. Prefix versions have te same precedence as unary plus and minus and are right associative.
