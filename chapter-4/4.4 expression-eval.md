# Expression Evaluation

- textbook table 4.2 has all the operators we've seen so far

Let's say we run
```
a = b += c++ - d + --e / -f
```
This is hard to understand. You can figure out where to add parentheses using table 4.2
- find thing with highest precedence
- add brackets
- loop

```
a = b += (c++) - d + --e / -f
a = b += (c++) - d + (--e) / -f
a = b += (c++) - d + (--e) / (-f)
a = b += (c++) - d + ((--e) / (-f))
a = b += (((c++) - d) + ((--e) / (-f)))
(a = (b += (((c++) - d) + ((--e) / (-f)))))
```

## Order of subexpression evaluation
Associativity and precedence let us break any big expression into subexpressions
- the value of the expression might depend on the order in which the subexpressions are evaluated...so we can't actually tell that always

C doesn't define the order in which subexpressions are evaluated (except those involving AND, OR, conditional and comma operators)
- ex. in `(a+b) * (c-d)` we don't know whether `(a+b)` will be evaluated before `c-d`
  - most expressions have the same value regardless of the order in which the subexpressions are evaluated
  - might not be true when a subexpression modifies one of its operands
```
a = 5;
c = (b = a + 2) - (a = 1);
```

The effect of executing the second statement is unefined; C stanard doesn't say what'll happen
- with most compilers c will be either 6 or 2
- If b = a+2 is evaluated first, b = 7 and c = 6
- but if a = 1 is evaluated first, b = 3 and c = 2

Don't write stuff that accesses the value of a variable and also modify the variable elsewhere in the expression

ex. the above accesses a to do a+2 but also modifies it by assigning it 1.

Just avoid using assignment in sub expressions. 

Assignment, increment, and decrement are the only operators that modify their operands.
- be careful
Ex. j can be one of two things here
```
i = 2;
j = i * i++;
```
- might assume it's 4
- could be 6 instead
scenario:
1. The second operand, the original value of i, is fetched, then i is incremented
2. The first operand (new value of i) is fetched
3. The new and old values of i are multiplied yielding 6

Fetching == go get it from memory.
- a later change won't affect a fetched valye which is typically stored in a CPU register

## Undefined behaviour
According to C, these guys cause "undefined behaviour"
```
c = (b = a + 2) - (a = 1);
j = i * i++;
```
