# Expression Statements

In C, ANY expression can be used as a statement. 
- regardless of type
- regardless of what it computes
- can be turned into a statement by appending a semicolon.
Ex. we can turn the expression `++i` into a statement `++i;`

- when it's executed `i` is first incremented then the new value of `i` is fetched
- however since `++i` is not part of a larger expression the value is discarded and the next statement is executed (but the change to `i` is permanent)
- kinda pointless other than for the side effect

Three examples:
1. `1` is stored into `i` then the new value of `i` is fetched byt not used
```
i = 1;
```
2. value of `i` is fetched but not used however `i` is decremented after
```
i--;
```
3. value of `i*j-1` is computed and discarded. no effect, no purpose since `i` and `j` are not changed.
```
i * j - 1;
```

Easy to typo a do-nothing expression like `i = j;` being `i + j;` by accident.
