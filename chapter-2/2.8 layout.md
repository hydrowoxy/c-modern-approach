# Layout of a C program

Think of a C program as a series of tokens
- groups of characters can't be split up without changing their meaning
- identifiers and keywords are tokens
- so are operators like + and -
- so are punctuation marks like a comma or semicolon
- so are string literals

Ex.
```
printf("Height: %d\n", height);
```
consists of seven tokens
1. `printf` -> identifier
2. `(` -> punctuation
3. `"Height: %d\n"` -> string literal
4. `,` -> punctuation
5. `height` -> identifier
6. `)` -> punctuation
7. `;` -> punctuation

The amount of space between tokens in a program isn't critical in most cases

At one extreme
- tokens can be crammed together with no space between then at all
- except where this would cause two tokens to merge into a third token

Ex. we could delete most of the space in the `celsius.c` program provided we leave space between tokens like `int` and `main` and between `float` and `farenheit`

```
#include <stdio.h>
#define FREEZING_PT 32.0f
#define SCALE_FACTOR (5.0f / 9.0f)                      
int main(void){ float farenheit, celsius; printf("Enter Farenheit temperature: "); scanf("%f", &farenheit);celsius = (farenheit - FREEZING_PT) * SCALE_FACTOR; printf("Celsius equivalent: %.1f\n", celsius); return 0;}
```

We could put main all on one line. But we can't put the whole program on one line because each preprocessing directive requires a separate line

Don't do this because it's cursed

C lets us insert any amount of space (blanks, tabs, newlines) between tokens:
- Statements can be divided over any number of lines
- Space between tokens makes it easier for the eye
- Indentation can make nesting easier to spot
- Blank lines divide a program into logical units 

Ex. in `celsius.c`
- space around operators makes them stand out
- indentation of statements and declarations in main makes them obviously belong to main
- blank lines divide main into five parts
  - declaring the farenheit and celsius variables
  - obtaining the farenheit temperature
  - calculating the value of celsius
  - printing the celsius temperature
  - returning to the operating system
- aligning the `{}` on new lines makes it easy to spot where main ends

Extra spaces can be added between tokens, not within them.
like 
```
fl oat farenheit, celsius;
```
will break
```
fl
oat farenheit, celsius
```
 will also break

You also can't split a string over two lines
```
printf("To C, or not to C:
that is the question.\n"); // this is wrong
```
There's a way to make a multiline string but you have to do it differently. to be learned later.
