# Reading Input
`dweight.c` isn't that useful because it just calculates a pre-defined dimensional weight
- need to take user inout
- we do this with `scanf`
  - This is C library's counterpart to `printf`
  - the `f` in `scanf`, like the `f` in `printf`, == formatted
  - both require use of a format string to specify appearance of in/output data
  - `scanf` needs to know what form the input data will take just as `printf` needs to know how to display output data

To read an int
```
scanf("%d", &i); // reads an int, stores into i
```
`%d` -> scanf reads input as an integer
`i` -> integer variable we want to store the input to
`&` -> hard to explain riht now but just usually (not always) needed for `scanf`

To read a float
```
scanf("%f", &x); // reads a float, stores into x
```
`%f` -> scanf reads input as a float
`x` -> float variable we want to store the input to
`&` -> same as above
