- `GCC` == used to stand for GNU C Compiler. Now stands for GNU Compiler Collection.
- `GNU` == GNU's Not Unix (pronounced guh new)
- The compiler replaces comments with a space
- You can't nest comments
- float == floating point because floats are stored in two parts
  - fraction (or mantissa) and exponent
  - Ex. 12.0 is stored as 1.5 * 2^3
  - Ex. where 1.5 is the fraction and 3 is the exponent
- why the `f` after floats
  - if you don't, it's a double
  - doubles can be larger than float
- only the first 31 chars of an identifier name are only required to be remembered by the compiler
  - so if two are identical for the first 31 and the 32nd is diff, compiler might not recognize it as different
- optimal indentation is three spaces according to some studies
