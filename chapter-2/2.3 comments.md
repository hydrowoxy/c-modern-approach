# Comments
`pun.c` is not documented booo
- best practice to have eveyr program include identifying info.
    - program name, date written, author, purpose, etc.
    - put it in comments
- `/* this is a comment */`
  - comments can appear anywhere

Ex. for `pun.c`
```
/* Name: pun.c */
/* Purpose: prints a bad pun. */
/* Author: K. N. King */
```
can be placed at the top of the file. 

Multiline comments:
```
/* Name: pun.c 
   Purpose: prints a bad pun.
   Author: K. N. King 
*/
```

You can also box it to make it stand out
```
/*************************************************
 * Name: pun.c                                   *
 * Purpose: prints a bad pun.                    *
 * Author: K. N. King                            *
 *************************************************/
```

Or do this by omitting three sides
```
/*
 * Name: pun.c                                   
 * Purpose: prints a bad pun.                    
 * Author: K. N. King                            
 */
```

Winged comments go in line with other code
`int main(void) /* beginning of main program */`

C99 also lets you use `//` for comments
`// this is a comment`
- Ends automaticallt at the end of a line
- Multiline can be done the old way or with these
```
// Name: pun.c                                   
// Purpose: prints a bad pun.                    
// Author: K. N. King                            
```

Newer comments are advantageous
- comment ends automatically; no chance of unterminated comment messing up your code
- Multiline comments stand out better becuase you need `//` at the start of each lines
