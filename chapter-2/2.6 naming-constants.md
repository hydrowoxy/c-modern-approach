# Defining names for constants

`dweight` has the magic number 166
- we can use "macro definition" to name it
```
#define INCHES_PER_POUND 166
```
- `#define` is a preprocessing directive
- so is `#include`
- no semicolon needed

When a program is compiled the preprocessor replaces each macro by the value it represents.
Ex.
```
weight = (volume + INCHES_PER_POUND - 1) / INCHES_PER_POUND;
```
becomes
```
weight = (volume + 166 - 1) / 166
```

The value of a macro can be an expression
Ex.
```
#define RECIPROCAL_OF_PI (1.0f / 3.14159f)
```

If it contains operators, the espression should be enclosed in parentheses

The all caps is a convention not a requirement
