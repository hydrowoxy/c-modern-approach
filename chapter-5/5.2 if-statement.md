# The `if` Statement

- choose between two alternatives by testing the value of an expression
- if (expression) statement

- parentheses around d expression are mandatory

- when executed the parentheses enclosed expression is executed
```
if (line_num == MAX_LINES)
    line_num = 0;
```
- don't confuse `=` with `==`
- `if(i==0)` tests if i equals zero but `if(i=0)` just assigns 0 to i and then tests whether the result is nonzero (like testing if it's true) so it'll always fail

To test if something  is inside a range (ex. `0 <= i < n`)
```
if (0 <= i && i < n)
```
To test the opposite (outside the range)
```
if (i < 0 || i >= n)
```
- note && became ||

## Compound statements 
compound statement loos like `{ statements }`
- by putting braces around a group of statements we can force the compiler to treat it as a single statement 
Ex. `{ line_num = 0; page_num++; }`
Same as 
```
{
    line_num = 0;
    page_num++;
}
```
So ex. how you'd use it in an `if` statement:
```
if (line_num == MAX_LINES){
    line_num = 0;
    page_num ++;
}
```

- common in loops and other places where C syntax requires one statement but we want more than one

## The `else` clause
if statement may have an else clause -> if (expression) statement else statement
- the else gets executed if the expression in parentheses has the value 0
Ex.
```
if (i > j)
    max = i;
else
    max = j;
```
- you can kinda put whatever you want in an `if` statement
- also you can have nested if statements
Ex. this one finds the largest of the numbers stored in i,j, and k and stores it in max
```
if (i > j)
    if (i > k)
        max = i;
    else
        max = k;
else
    if (j > k)
        max = j;
    else
        max = k;
```
