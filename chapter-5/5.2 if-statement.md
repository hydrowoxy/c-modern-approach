# The `if` Statement

- choose between two alternatives by testing the value of an expression
- if (expression) statement

- parentheses around d expression are mandatory

- when executed the parentheses enclosed expression is executed
```
if (line_num == MAX_LINES)
    line_num = 0;
```
- don't confuse `=` with `==`
- `if(i==0)` tests if i equals zero but `if(i=0)` just assigns 0 to i and then tests whether the result is nonzero (like testing if it's true) so it'll always fail

To test if something  is inside a range (ex. `0 <= i < n`)
```
if (0 <= i && i < n)
```
To test the opposite (outside the range)
```
if (i < 0 || i >= n)
```
- note && became ||

## Compound statements 
compound statement loos like `{ statements }`
- by putting braces around a group of statements we can force the compiler to treat it as a single statement 
Ex. `{ line_num = 0; page_num++; }`
Same as 
```
{
    line_num = 0;
    page_num++;
}
```
So ex. how you'd use it in an `if` statement:
```
if (line_num == MAX_LINES){
    line_num = 0;
    page_num ++;
}
```

- common in loops and other places where C syntax requires one statement but we want more than one

## The `else` clause
if statement may have an else clause -> if (expression) statement else statement
- the else gets executed if the expression in parentheses has the value 0
Ex.
```
if (i > j)
    max = i;
else
    max = j;
```
- you can kinda put whatever you want in an `if` statement
- also you can have nested if statements
Ex. this one finds the largest of the numbers stored in i,j, and k and stores it in max
```
if (i > j)
    if (i > k)
        max = i;
    else
        max = k;
else
    if (j > k)
        max = j;
    else
        max = k;
```

- you can nest 'em all you want
- you can also add braces so it doesn't hurt your eyes
  - readability! compiler safety!

## Cascaded `if` statements
Example
```
if
else if
else
```
- else isn't always present
- also wow this is not a new kind of if statement it's just a syntax thing
- it's just an if statement with another if statement as the else clause
- wow mind blown
- and u can keep doing that ad infinitum


# The "dangling `else`" problem
- when if statements are nested, we've got to watch for this
consider...
```
if (y!=0)
    if(x!=0)
        result = x/y;
else
    printf ("Error: y is equal to 0 \n");
```
- To which if statement does the `else` clause belong?
- indentation suggests it belongs to the outer statement
- but C says that it belongs to the nearest if statement that hasn't already been paired with an else
so in this example it actually belongs to the inner if statement, like this
```
if (y!=0)
    if(x!=0)
        result = x/y;
    else
        printf ("Error: y is equal to 0 \n");
```
to make the else part of the outside we can enclose the inner if statement in braces
```
if (y!=0) {
    if(x!=0)
        result = x/y;
} else
    printf ("Error: y is equal to 0 \n");
```
- value of braces!

## Conditional expressions
Conditional operator consists of two symbols, `?` and `:`, which must be used together like this:
```
expr1 ? expr2 : expr3
```
- these can be expressions of any type
- the result is called a consitional expression
- conditional operator is unique because it needs three iperands
- "ternary" operator

can be read like "If expr1 then expr2 else expr3"
- evaluated in stages
- first expr1
- if it's nonzero then expr2, and that value is the value of the entire expression
- if it's zero then expr3, and that value is the value of the entire expression

example
```
int i,j,k;

i = 1;
j = 2;

k = i > j ? i : j; // k is now 2
k = ( i >= 0 ? i : 0) + j; // k is now 3
```

- first conditional expression returns the valye of either i or j depending which is larger
- these make programs shorter but harder to understand
  - avoid them i guess

- sometimes they're tempting for example for a return statement
instead of
```
if (i > j)
    return i;
else
    return j;
```
you can write
```
return i > j ? i : j;
```
- also calls of printf can sometimes benefit in a similar way
instead of
```
if (i > j)
    printf("%d\n", i);
else
    printf("%d\n", j);
```
you can write
```
printf("%d\n", i > j ? i : j);
```
- common in some macro definitions too

## Booleans in C89
- for many years it had none
- none in C89 standard
- minor annoyance
- you can declare a flag to work around this
- just doesn't help readability
- programmers in C89 often define macros with namea TRUE and FALSE
```
#define TRUE 1
#define FALSE 0
```
then you can test
```
if(flag)
if(!flag)
```
or
```
if (flag == TRUE)
if (flag == FALSE)
```
- former is better

You could even do this
```
#define BOOL int

BOOL flag;
```
